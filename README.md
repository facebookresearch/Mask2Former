### Features
* A single architecture for panoptic, instance and semantic segmentation.
* Support major segmentation datasets: ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO, Mapillary Vistas.

## Updates
* Add Google Colab demo.
* Video instance segmentation is now supported! Please check our [tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10764) for more details.

## Installation
